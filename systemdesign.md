# üé∏ VocalVibe - System Design Document

**AI AGENT CONTEXT**: This is a music learning app (think Guitar Hero meets Duolingo for singing). Users sing into their mic, get real-time pitch feedback, and level up their vocal skills through gamified lessons.

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW
- **Goal**: Build a viral music learning app with modern tech stack
- **Target**: Get hired as a full-stack TypeScript developer
- **Timeline**: MVP in 1 week, polish in 1 month
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with Next.js frontend + Hono backend

üéØ CORE PRODUCT LOOP

User opens app ‚Üí instant mic access (no signup)
Picks a song/lesson ‚Üí sees notes coming at them
Sings into mic ‚Üí sees real-time pitch feedback
Completes song ‚Üí gets score, XP, dopamine hit
Unlocks next challenge ‚Üí returns tomorrow for streak

üèó TECH STACK (2025 HIRE-WORTHY)
yamlFrontend:
  Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
  State: Zustand + TanStack Query
  Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
  Audio: Web Audio API + Tone.js
  3D/Games: Three.js + React Three Fiber
  Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
  Testing: Vitest + Playwright

Backend:
  Runtime: Bun (faster than Node)
  Framework: Hono (faster than Express)
  ORM: Drizzle (TypeScript-first)
  Database: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech for serverless)
  Auth: Lucia Auth v3
  Validation: Zod everywhere
  Realtime: PartyKit (better than Socket.io)

Infrastructure:
  Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
  Database: Neon (Postgres) + Upstash (Redis)
  Storage: Uploadthing or S3
  Monitoring: Sentry + PostHog
  CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  Email: Resend

üî• KEY FEATURES (MVP)
Phase 1: Core Magic (Week 1)

 Mic input + pitch detection
 Visual pitch indicator
 Single song with note highway
 Basic scoring
 Local storage persistence

Phase 2: Addiction Mechanics (Week 2)

üéÆ AUDIO ENGINE SPECS
typescript// Client-side pitch detection
class AudioEngine {
  - Sample rate: 44100 Hz
  - Buffer size: 2048
  - Pitch algorithm: Autocorrelation (ML5.js or Pitchy)
  - Latency target: <50ms
  - Confidence threshold: 0.8
}

// Scoring algorithm
score = (accuracy * 0.6) + (timing * 0.3) + (combo * 0.1)
// Accuracy: How close to target pitch
// Timing: Hit notes in time window
// Combo: Consecutive correct notes

üß† AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
When I ask you to implement something:

Use the tech stack above (no substitutions)
Make it beautiful by default (use shadcn/ui)
Add animations (Framer Motion)
Include error handling
Add loading states
Make it mobile responsive
Use TypeScript strictly
Follow the folder structure
Keep components under 150 lines
Extract hooks for logic

üé® UI/UX PRINCIPLES

Instant feedback (no loading screens)
Juice everything (particles, sounds, haptics)
Progress visible always (XP bar, streak counter)
One-thumb mobile navigation
60fps animations minimum
Celebrate wins (confetti, sounds)

üìù CURRENT FOCUS
TODAY'S GOAL: Get pitch detection working with visual feedback
THIS WEEK: Ship MVP with 1 song playable
THIS MONTH: 100 users with >20% retention
